# 2D Platformer Game

This repository contains a 2D Platformer Game that I have developed. It's a complete game with various features and mechanics implemented. The game is built using unity game engine and is ready to play.

## Gameplay

The game is a classic 2D platformer where players control a character and navigate through levels filled with obstacles and enemies. The objective is to reach the end of each level while collecting points and power-ups along the way.

## Features

- **Animations with sprites:** The game utilizes sprite animations to bring characters and objects to life.
- **Player and enemy movement:** Players can move left, right, and jump. Enemies have their own movement patterns and behaviors.
- **Level creation using tilemaps:** Levels are created using tilemaps, allowing for easy level design and modification.
- **Scene traversal and triggers:** Scenes can transition seamlessly as players move between different areas. Triggers activate events or actions within the game.
- **Collectibles and scoring:** Players can collect items throughout the levels, earning score points.
- **Level locking/unlocking:** Levels can be locked or unlocked based on player progress.
- **Singleton pattern usage:** The game uses the Singleton pattern for managing important components and data.
- **Collectible-based level completion:** Levels require collecting a certain number of items to complete them.
- **Coroutines:** Coroutines are used for handling asynchronous operations and timing-related tasks.
